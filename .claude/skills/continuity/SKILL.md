name: continuity
description: Stop and pick work back up with nothing lost. Use when the user says "start a handoff", "wrap up" or that they will clear context, and when they say "continue the goal we were working on" or "pick this back up".

Use the `genlock` command, or the genlock MCP tools if connected. If it is not on PATH, use `npx @locklainn/genlock`.

## Continuity: stop and pick back up with nothing lost

There is no handoff document. Goals say what is next, tickets say what just happened, and everything live is read when asked for.

    genlock orient                          # at the start of a session
    genlock checkpoint [--uncommitted ".."] # before context is cleared
    genlock continue [GOAL|TICKET]          # to carry on

- **"Start a handoff" means run `genlock checkpoint`.** Also "wrap up", or "I'm going to clear context". It refuses and names what a fresh session would be missing. Fill each gap with what is actually true, then tell the user it is safe to clear.
- **"Let's continue the goal we were working on" means run `genlock continue`.** If it says more than one goal could be meant, ask which. Then take a ticket with `genlock start ID`.
- **Say what must not be done** with `genlock forbid ID "..." --lifted-by ".."`, and what a later agent must check with `genlock hazard TICKET "..." --verify ".."`. Both are printed until lifted or cleared. Restarting a blocked ticket needs `--because`. A stop or a block means stop: do not retry it under another name or hand it to another agent.
- **Findings do not go in records.** What the work established stays in files; `genlock ref ID PATH --why ".."` points at them. `latest` is limited to 600 characters, on purpose. Withdraw a decision with `genlock decide ID ".." --supersedes N`; it stays visible so nobody re-adds it.
- **Records are claims about the repository, not sources.** Check anything load-bearing before acting on it.
- **Do not write a separate handoff file.** Put it on the goal or the ticket. A second copy goes stale and still reads as current.
- **Commit `.genlock/` with the work when the user asks for a commit,** or with `genlock sync`. `.genlock/` must not be discarded by a git cleanup: uncommitted records exist nowhere else.
